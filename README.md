# Minerva - Intelligence V2

Welcome to Minerva!  

This is Rackspace's Intelligence UI for the Monitoriing & Metrics platform.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Angular-ClI
3. NPM install
4. Run the application

## Cloning The Repo

```
cd working_dir
git clone git@github.com:racker/Minerva.git
```

## Install Angular-CLI

npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## NPM Install

This  will install all the application and developer dependencies into your `node_modules` folder

```
npm install
```

## Run The App

Running the application is quite simple, but there are a few options for us to take a look at

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component <component-name>` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
